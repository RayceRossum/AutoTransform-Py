### Overview

A common application of supervised machine learning is identifying the object of an image. One issue that users encounter is a model misclassifying a new image because the object is rotated or translated in some way that was not captured in the training images. The purpose of this package is to create a more robust set of images for users to train their model with. The package will accept a set of images as an input, apply a series of translations to them, and return a larger, robust training set. Translations include: rotating, mirroring, shifting the object's location in the frame, darkening, and colour manipulations.
